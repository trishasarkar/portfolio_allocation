# Portfolio Allocation

We conducated a brief literature survey to analyse the research on portofolio allocation and identified the following gaps:
* Lack of focus on Indian datasets
* Analysis of only historical data

This project considers data of Indian companies - NIFTY 50 companies. The model uses the recent data (as recent as 2022) of NIFTY 50 stocks (45 companies) and can be automated to consider a closing day/time of one's choice.
